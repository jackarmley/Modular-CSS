//Modular CSS file

Designed to be used with a HTML5 doctype.

Added richard Clark's reset with a few modifications (removed presentational styles).

Also, there's a set of clean base styles, commented to remind me of what these new-fangled HTML5 tags are for (and how originl ones like <hr /> have been repurposed.

There's areas for more specific styling that have been left deliberately blank.
